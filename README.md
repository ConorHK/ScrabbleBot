# ScrabbleBot
Java bot for COMP20050

Scrabble driver code provided by Professor Chris Bleakly. Our team (Gooses) bot code is in Gooses.java. Note that we were limited to one class file so we had to make use of nested classes, and as such the file is a little bit of a mess.

**Result**: 7th place out of 46 teams.
Our biggest downfall was the lack of blank tile implementation. We adopted a strategy of trading away any blanks we got, however the blank can be used to make very high point plays, which our bot couldn't compete against.
